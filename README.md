![pytorch 1.4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/pytorch-1.4.0-green.svg?style=plastic)

## Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch >= 1.4
- CUDA 10.0 or CUDA 10.1
- GCC 5.4.0

1. Create Conda Environment

   ```bash
   conda create --name mcmsr python=3.7
   conda activate mcmsr
   ```

1. Install Dependencies

   ```bash
   cd mcmsr
   conda install pytorch=1.4.0 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
   pip install mmcv==0.4.4
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Install MMSR and DCNv2

    ```bash
    python setup.py develop
    cd mmsr/models/archs/DCNv2
    python setup.py build develop
    ```

### Train

All logging files in the training process, *e.g.*, log message, checkpoints, and snapshots, will be saved to `./experiments` and `./tb_logger` directory.

1. Modify the paths to dataset in the following yaml files for configuration.
   ```bash
   ./options/train/stage1_teacher_contras_network.yml
   ./options/train/stage2_student_contras_network.yml
   ./options/train/stage3_restoration_gan.yml
   ```

1. Stage 1: Train teacher contrastive network.
   ```bash
   python mmsr/train.py -opt "options/train/stage1_teacher_contras_network.yml"
   ```

1. Stage 2: Train student contrastive network.
   ```bash
   # add the path to *pretrain_model_teacher* in the following yaml
   # the path to *pretrain_model_teacher* is the model obtained in stage1
   ./options/train/stage2_student_contras_network.yml
   python mmsr/train.py -opt "options/train/stage2_student_contras_network.yml"
   ```

1. Stage 3: Train restoration network.
   ```bash
   # add the path to *pretrain_model_feature_extractor* in the following yaml
   # the path to *pretrain_model_feature_extractor* is the model obtained in stage2
   ./options/train/stage3_restoration_gan.yml
   python mmsr/train.py -opt "options/train/stage3_restoration_gan.yml"

   # if you wish to train the restoration network with only mse loss
   # prepare the dataset path and pretrained model path in the following yaml
   ./options/train/stage3_restoration_mse.yml
   python mmsr/train.py -opt "options/train/stage3_restoration_mse.yml"
   ```
